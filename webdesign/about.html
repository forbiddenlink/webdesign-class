    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>Sally's Sandwiches and Subs was brought to life in May of 2012. The owner Sally had a dream - to create a sandwich shop
        where people could go for a good meal at a cheap price. After two years of planning, Sally was able to bring her dream to reality. All of our meats are sliced fresh per order - so we always give you
        the best that we can!
        Originally, she was just going to offer a few sandwiches - but then came up with the idea to include subs also so she could have more items on 
        the menu and provide more choices.
    </p>

    <p>
    Located just 20 minutes south of Pittsburgh, Sally's has grown into quite the food "boulder" of the community for the past 10 years. On weekends when you drive by,
    the parking lot is always fulls and the people seen leaving are smiling and full.
    </p>

    <p>Fresh, affordable food, a clean enviornment, and a friendly waitstaff are the things Sally's prides itself in.</p>

    <p>Stop in soon and see for yourself!s</p>
